 ## ***DESCRIPTION***
 ### Indigo is a new social media app that combines user messaging threads with new polling technology to gauge popularity and facilitate discourse on topics, posts, and ideas. User posts support a wide variety of content including rich text, images, videos, and GIFs. Other users can view content and comment as normal, however instead of a like or dislike, users can choose one of three colors for a reaction; red, blue or indigo. Default parameters allow for red = negative response, blue = positive response, indigo = middle/wildcard, however the post can also specify a use case for each response. In turn, comments can also be voted upon, similar to Upvotes in Reddit. The number/percentage of each response is displayed as a bar underneath the post or comment with relative ratios of each color. Indigo features a mobile-first design and seeks to implement a fun and intuitive UI. Posts and comments will be sorted and searchable as most popular, along with most and least agreed.
